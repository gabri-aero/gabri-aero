- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabri-aero
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering and science, specially computational modelling and everything to do with space and that stuff. 🚀🛰️
- ⭐ I am now focusing on developing simulations on the field of astrodynamics to build a solid knowledge about it. You can check my astrodynamics library [here](https://github.com/gabri-aero/astrosim).
- ➕ I would also like to learn more about CFD, FEM, Deep Learning and genetic algorithms.
- 🖥️ The main programming languages I am using for my simulations are Python and C++. I have also worked with MATLAB and Simulink modelling and a little with Java.
